# Project Overview
This Metronome Application is written in C# using Windows Forms .NET. It is a simple metronome that accommodates custom beats per minute and time signatures, and offers tap tempo, multiple different metronome samples, a volume slider, and an embedded YouTube Music player. This project is a solo personal project that I created so that I wouldn't have to always have two separate applications or browser windows open when practicing an instrument.
